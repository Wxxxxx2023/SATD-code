EMF,negative,a single separator possibly preceded by some parent reference segments is redundant
EMF,negative,an empty path needs to be replaced by a single if there is no query to distinguish it from a current document reference
EMF,negative,collapses non ending empty segments parent references and self references in a non relative path returning the same path that would be produced from the base hierarchical uri as part of a resolve
EMF,negative,we  ve either reached the end of the string the address ends in an ipv address or it is invalid scanhexsequence has already made sure that we have the right number of bits
EMF,negative,refresh any actions that may become enabled or disabled
EMF,negative,if the path is non empty and originally ended in an empty segment a parent reference or a self reference add a trailing separator
EMF,negative,typeconverterimpl
EMF,negative,returns a string representation of this uri for debugging explicitly showing each of the components
EMF,negative,add a listener to set the most recent command is affected objects to be the selection of the viewer with focus
EMF,negative,try to select the affected objects
EMF,negative,create the editing domain with a special command stack
EMF,negative,make sure it is okay
EMF,negative,if it is changing
EMF,negative,if the new prefix has segments it is not the root absolute path and we need to drop the trailing empty segment and append the tail segments
EMF,negative,do nothing
EMF,negative,featuremap add estructuralfeature cursor o expectedmodcount featuremap getmodcount entrycursor lastcursor lastcursor prepared 
EMF,negative,create the listener on demand
EMF,negative,add all classes from this package first to guarantee they get the simple names
EMF,negative,this just notifies those things that are affected by the section
EMF,negative,do not even consider it unless this is hierarchical and has scheme authority device and path absoluteness equal to those of the prefix
EMF,negative,if the prefix has no segments then it is the root absolute path and we know this is an absolute path too
EMF,negative,stop listening to the old one
EMF,negative,start listening to the new one
EMF,negative,remember it
EMF,negative,barring a better result this will be the result
EMF,negative,load the resource through the editing domain
EMF,negative,creates the model from the editor input
EMF,negative,the prefix really is a prefix of this if this has just one more empty segment the paths are the same
EMF,negative,only creates the other pages if there is something that can be edited
EMF,negative,do this here because getextendedmetadata is used during initialization and the mappings are are populated the first time it is fetched which will miss the packages we add as we initialize the tree
EMF,negative,create a page for the selection tree view
EMF,negative,public list sublist estructuralfeature feature int from int to return null
EMF,negative,rewriter is required for set methods
EMF,negative,ensures that this editor will only display the page is tab area if there are more than one page
EMF,negative,the content outline is just a tree
EMF,negative,ignore
EMF,negative,if we ca not add it it must already be in the list so find it and move it to the end
EMF,negative,both eobject and eobject are not null if eobject has been compared already
EMF,negative,if the target is read only we can ask the platform to release it
EMF,negative,range to look for comments
EMF,negative,create package meta data objects
EMF,negative,encodes the given string replacing each ascii character that is not in the set specified by the bit bitmask and each non ascii character below xa by an escape sequence of followed by two hex digits if is not in the set but ignoreescaped is true then will not be encoded iff it already begins a valid escape sequence
EMF,negative,tests whether an escape occurs in the given string starting at index i an escape sequence is a followed by two hex digits
EMF,negative,multiple jet directives
EMF,negative,there is no reason they are not equal so they are
EMF,negative,if the set states are the same and the values of the feature are the structurally equal they are equal
