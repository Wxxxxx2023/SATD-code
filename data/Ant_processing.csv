Ant,positive,fixme formatters are not thread safe
Ant,positive,xxx jon skeet the comment if it has not been done already may not be strictly true wrapper maybeconfigure  wo not configure the same attributes text more than once but it may well add the children again unless i have missed something
Ant,positive,i hate to admit it but we do not know what happened here throw the exception
Ant,positive,just a note starteam has a status for new which implies that there is an item on your local machine that is not in the repository these are the items that show up as not in view in the starteam gui one would think that we would want to perhaps checkin the new items not in all cases steve cohen dec  unfortunately the sdk does not really work and we ca not actually see anything with a status of new that is why we can just check out everything here without worrying about losing anything
Ant,positive,the generated classes must not be added in the generic jar is that buggy on old jonas ?
Ant,positive,todo is this comment still relevant ? fixme need to use a saxsource as the source for the transform so we can plug in our own entity resolver
Ant,positive,this is turned off temporarily there appears to be a bug in selectorutils matchpattern  where it is recursive on windows even if no is in pattern assertequals ffftffffffff results unix vs assertequals ffftfffftfff results windows
Ant,positive,pattern now holds while string is not exhausted this will generate false positives but we can live with that
Ant,positive,fixme is no namespace is empty namespace really ok ?
Ant,positive,fixme this is actually not very cpu cycles friendly as we are converting from dos to java while the underlying sun implementation will convert from java to dos time for internal storage
Ant,positive,check first that it is not already loaded otherwise consecutive runs seems to end into an outofmemoryerror or it fails when there is a native library to load several times this is far from being perfect but should work in most cases
Ant,positive,todo a warning line that shows code which contains a variable error will cause some trouble the parser should definitely be much better
Ant,positive,todo is this comment still relevant ? fixme need to use a saxsource as the source for the transform so we can plug in our own entity resolver
Ant,positive,xxx i really do not like this the xml processor is still too involved in the processing a better solution imo would be to create ue for project and target too and then process the tree and have project target deal with its attributes similar with description if we eventually switch to or add support for dom things will work smoothly ue can be avoided almost completely it could still be created on demand for backward compatibility
Ant,positive,junit wraps solo tests this way we can extract the original test name with a little hack
Ant,positive,xxx ignore attributes in a different ns maybe store them ?
Ant,positive,borrowed from tokenfiltertest
Ant,positive,xxx move to project so it is shared by all helpers
Ant,positive,what is the property supposed to be ?
Ant,positive,pr hack for ant type value an ant type is a component name which can be namespaced need to extract the name and convert from qualified name to uri name
Ant,positive,there is a convenient xsltc class version but data are private so use package information
Ant,positive,stolen from org apache xerces impl xmlentitymanager getuserdir  of the xerces j team which ascii characters need to be escaped
Ant,positive,bingo append it this should normally not be done here
Ant,positive,this is faintly ridiculous
Ant,positive,cannot remove underscores due to protected visibility
Ant,positive,todo not read yet in a public setter
Ant,positive,pr i do not know what to do if the object class has multiple defines but this is for logging only
Ant,positive,not sure what could be the need of this
Ant,positive,xxx jon skeet any reason for writing a message and then using a bare runtimeexception rather than just using a buildexception here ? is it in case the message could end up being written to no loggers as the loggers could have failed to be created due to this failure ?
Ant,positive,experimental testing will be removed
Ant,positive,xxx should instead make a new protectiondomain with a codesource corresponding to container touri  tourl  and the same permissioncollection as project class protectiondomain had
Ant,positive,this is really irritating we need a way to set stuff
Ant,positive,xxx all this to convert source to destination directory according to weblogic standards can be written better this is too hacky
Ant,positive,silly hack to avoid stack overflow
Ant,positive,access to property tables this is used to support ant call and similar tasks it should be deprecated it is possible to use a better more efficient mechanism to preserve the context
Ant,positive,xxx should throw an exception instead ?
Ant,positive,temporary until we figure a better api
Ant,positive,there is a better way to save the context this should not delegate to next it is for backward compatibility only
Ant,positive,quick fix for ant java use of property before initializing the project
Ant,positive,xxx we should use jcvs www ice com jcvs instead of command line execution so that we do not rely on having native cvs stuff around sm
Ant,positive,two reasons are mentioned in the api docs for file list  dir is not a directory this is impossible as we would not get here in this case  an io error occurred why does not it throw an exception then ? ?
Ant,positive,jakarta commons logging listener note do not use the simplelog as your logger implementation as it causes an infinite loop since it writes to system err which ant traps and reroutes to the logger listener layer the following names are used for the log org apache tools ant project project name for project events org apache tools ant target target name for target events task class name target name for events in individual targets in all target and project names we replace and with todo we should use the advanced context logging features and expose them in c l first todo this is very inefficient switching the out and tracking the logs can be optimized a lot but may require few more changes to the core since ant 
Ant,positive,todo using taskname here is brittle as a user could override it this should probably be modified to use the classname instead
Ant,positive,these are pathological cases but retained in case somebody subclassed us
Ant,positive,this is a rather hairy case one of our subclasses knows that we need to update the archive but at the same time there are no resources known to us that would need to be added only the subclass seems to know what is going on this happens if jar detects that the manifest has changed for example the manifest is not part of any resources because of our support for inline manifest s if we invoke createemptyzip like ant  did we will loose all stuff that has been in the original archive bugzilla report 
Ant,positive,this is deprecated use classespath in the future
Ant,positive,xxx this array stuff is a remnant of prev trials gotta remove
Ant,positive,set the number of milliseconds leeway to give before deciding a target is out of date todo this is not yet used param granularity the granularity used to decide if a target is out of date
Ant,positive,this may change if we add advanced parsing capabilities
Ant,positive,we assume that every output jikes does stands for an error warning xxx is this correct ?
Ant,positive,the line below is a hack the system id must an uri but it is not cleat to get the uri of an resource so just set the name of the resource as a system id
Ant,positive,xxx what is the following doing ? should it run if javadoc executable "null" ?
Ant,positive,mac os and previous todo i have no idea how to get it someone must fix it
Ant,positive,todo nothing appears to read this but is set using a public setter
Ant,positive,xxx we are committing combiningchar and extender here
Ant,positive,xxx failed to load the class properly should we print a warning here ?
Ant,positive,xxx could perhaps also call thread stop  not sure if anyone cares
Ant,positive,xxx perhaps we should not use properties for these three options emacs mode warnings and pedantic  but include it in the javac directive ?
Ant,positive,xxx maybe use reflection to addpathelement other patterns ?
Ant,positive,todo there is a problem with the constructor for the rbc you have to provide the rules in the constructors no setters available
Ant,positive,probably not the best choice but it solves the problem of relative paths in classpath
Ant,positive,fix for invalid characters if you think of more add to the list
Ant,positive,fallback in case we have trouble loading the class or do not know how to handle it there is no easy way to know what idl mode would generate this is supposed to make ant always recompile the class as a file of that name should not exist
Ant,positive,check it out also ugly
Ant,positive,i ca not get my head around this is encoding treatment needed here ?
Ant,positive,quick dirty to make nested mapped p sets work
Ant,positive,xxx is this code still necessary ? is there any  port ? pull in zip from packages directory
Ant,positive,only the developer knows what s he is doing
Ant,positive,xxx unfortunately jdk adds entryset  keyset  values  implementing this requires a small hack we can add it later
Ant,positive,first developer could use a little help
Ant,positive,xxx should throw an exception instead ?
Ant,positive,xxx should throw an exception instead ?
Ant,positive,xxx should throw an exception instead ?

Ant,positive,since java  return normalizedpath split  workaround for java  
Ant,positive,hammer end inline maingtu
Ant,positive,this array really should not be here again for historical purposes it is p fixme this array should be in a private or package private location since it could be modified by malicious code p
Ant,positive,should move to a separate public class and have api to add listeners etc
Ant,positive,should become a single empty argument same for pr 
Ant,positive,not very nice but will do the job
Ant,positive,provide public visibility
Ant,positive,not used but public so theoretically must remain for bc ?
Ant,positive,super validateattributes  do not want to call this method
Ant,positive,xxx what is this for ?
Ant,positive,we keep this so we have something to delete in later tests
Ant,positive,copied from concattest
Ant,positive,not sure whether this is clean but this method is declared not to throw exceptions
Ant,positive,we just set the prefix for this fileset and pass it up do we need to do this ? lh
Ant,positive,why do we do nothing ?
Ant,positive,we have to deal with assembly  the programmer can be writing little byte chunks for all we know and we must assemble complete records for writing review maybe this should be in tarbuffer ? could that help to eliminate some of the buffer copying
Ant,positive,this is the new better way use classespath instead of sourcespath the code is currently the same you need class files in a directory to use this or jar files
Ant,positive,xxx why not simply new file dir filename ?
Ant,positive,this is ugly checking for the root folder
Ant,positive,todo parameterise ? call compiler as class dont want to fork again use classic compiler can be parameterised ?
Ant,positive,xxx all this to get package according to weblogic standards can be written better this is too hacky careful similar code in scandir but slightly different
Ant,positive,stolen from writemanifest
Ant,positive,if the jarfile already exists then whack it and recreate it should probably think of a more elegant way to handle this so that in case of errors we do not leave people worse off than when we started
Ant,positive,xxx is the following really necessary ? it is in the same thread group
Ant,positive,we have to find a cleaner way to put this output
Ant,positive,this is the old way and is deprecated classespath is the right way to do this and is above
Ant,positive,for script example that modifies ided tasks in other targets to work very ugly the reference is replaced by runtimeconfigurable
Ant,positive,do not call super close  because that reader is used on other places
Ant,positive,report error if something weird happens this is diagnostic
Ant,positive,sorry otherwise we will get a classcastexception because the mockcache is loaded by two different classloader
Ant,positive,hack we ask the vm to create an instance by voluntarily providing illegal arguments to force the vm to run the class static initializer while at the same time not running a valid constructor
Ant,positive,singleton for now it may change per classloader
Ant,positive,xxx should not this always return false in isolated mode ?
Ant,positive,to do delete the file if it is not a valid file
Ant,positive,todo comment field does not include all options yet
Ant,positive,to do delete the file if it is not a valid file
Ant,positive,this method checks the timestamp on each file listed in the code ejbfiles code and compares them to the timestamp on the code jarfile code if the code jarfile code is timestamp is more recent than each ejb file code true code is returned otherwise code false code is returned todo find a way to check the manifest file that is found by naming convention param ejbfiles hashtable of ejb classes and other files that will be added to the completed jar file param jarfile jar file which will contain all of the ejb classes and other files return boolean indicating whether or not the code jarfile code is up to date

Ant,positive,todo comment field does not include all options yet
Ant,positive,todo no methods yet for getclassname todo no method for newinstance using a reverse classloader
Ant,positive,the displayname variable stores the value of the display name element from the standard ejb descriptor as a future enhancement to this task we may determine the name of the ejb jar file using this display name but this has not be implemented yet
Ant,positive,an output stream that compresses into the bzip format without the file header chars into another stream p the compression requires large amounts of memory thus you should call the link close  close  method as soon as possible to force tt cbzipoutputstream tt to release the allocated memory p p you can shrink the amount of allocated memory and maybe raise the compression speed by choosing a lower blocksize which in turn may cause a lower compression ratio you can avoid unnecessary memory allocation by avoiding using a blocksize which is bigger than the size of the input p p you can compute the memory usage for compressing by the following formula p pre code k  blocksize code pre p to get the memory required for decompression by link cbzipinputstream cbzipinputstream use p pre code k  blocksize code pre table width border colgroup col width col width col width colgroup tr th colspan memory usage by blocksize th tr tr th align right blocksize th th align right compression br memory usage th th align right decompression br memory usage th tr tr td align right k td td align right k td td align right k td tr tr td align right k td td align right k td td align right k td tr tr td align right k td td align right k td td align right k td tr tr td align right k td td align right k td td align right k td tr tr td align right k td td align right k td td align right k td tr tr td align right k td td align right k td td align right k td tr tr td align right k td td align right k td td align right k td tr tr td align right k td td align right k td td align right k td tr tr td align right k td td align right k td td align right k td tr table p for decompression tt cbzipinputstream tt allocates less memory if the bzipped input is smaller than one block p p instances of this class are not threadsafe p p todo update to bzip  p

Ant,positive,the property is an id is thing either a property or a path we need to make sure that the object was created with the given id we do not have an adequate way of testing the actual value of the path object though
Ant,positive,where oh where has my test case gone ?
Ant,positive,attribute names and values while the xml spec does not require preserving the order afaik  some ant tests do rely on the exact order the following code is copied from attributeimpl we could also just use sax attributes and convert to sax dom attribute nodes can also be stored in sax attributes xxx under jdk  you can just use a linkedhashmap for this purpose jglick the only exception to this order is the treatment of refid a number of datatypes check if refid is set when other attributes are set this check will not work if the build script has the other attribute before the refid attribute so now ant  the refid attribute will be processed first

Ant,negative,filesets has been protected so we need to keep that even after switching to resource collections in fact they will still get a different treatment form the other resource collections even in execute since we have some subtle special features like switching type to dir when we encounter a dirset that would be more difficult to achieve otherwise

Ant,negative,chunk part of previous env var unix env vars can contain embedded new lines
Ant,negative,but if no dest is specified compare source to source

Ant,negative,for historical and performance reasons we have to do things in a rather complex way  move is optimized to move directories if a fileset has been included completely therefore filesets need a special treatment this is also required to support the failonerror semantice skip filesets with broken basedir but handle the remaining collections we carry around a few protected methods that work on basedirs and arrays of names to optimize stuff all resources with the same basedir get collected in separate lists and then each list is handled in one go
