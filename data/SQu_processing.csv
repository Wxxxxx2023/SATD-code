e background and foreground colors only work if run after the super call but font only works if run before the super call may be a bug in jdk
SQu,positive,fails on db for linux however windows fixpak driver works without exception also linux server with driver works fine as well
SQu,positive,bug ms sql is inconsistent with regard to setting the current catalog if you have a database with periods or spaces then in some cases you must surround the catalog with quotes for example if you have a catalog named  db with spaces  you must execute the following sql use db with spaces however the same is not always true for the jdbc api method connection setcatalog for some old versions of microsoft drivers you must quote the catalog as well but for newer versions of the driver you must not quote the catalog so here we attempt to use the unquoted version first then if that fails we will try quoting it
SQu,positive,this is here because addcompletionsatlistbegin wo not work when schema info is still loading

SQu,positive,if we are connecting to a database then this is fine however when using mockobjects this is problematic since there are many unimplemented methods in the mockobjects implementation that are required by this
SQu,positive,issue after importing the data we could tell the user that it has been successfully imported this would give good positive feedback however it would mean that they need to click on yet another button to dismiss that message on the other hand since the operation is synchronous the user cannot proceed to do anything until it is done if we assume that import usually works correctly unless they are shown an error message then we do not need to display anything here
SQu,positive,todo this wo not work when the column has values with quotes in them use preparedstatements instead
SQu,positive,todo when is the earliest version supported include the following line here scrollpane setwheelscrollingenabled true the scroll wheel function is important for ease of use but the setwheelscrollingenabled function is not available in java 
SQu,positive,in case this is called by the awt thread log a message this is most likey a bug
SQu,positive,bug it is very important to get the uri from the url and not simply do new file url getfile in the case where the path contains spaces they get encoded as in the string returned from url getfile java io file does not know how to deal with them i e replace them with spaces and the resulting file is rendered non existent

SQu,positive,note some dbmss such as oracle do not allow select rowid from table you cannot have any column name in the columns clause if you have in there aliasing the table name seems to be the best way to get around the problem
SQu,positive,we are displaying a new dataset so if there was a cell editor in operation tell it to cancel ? ? ? ? how does this impact popup display ?
SQu,positive,kludge we want some info about the columns to be available for validating the user input during cell editing operations ideally we would get that info inside the resultsetdataset class during the creation of the columndefinition objects by using various functions in resultsetmetadata such as isnullable idx unfortunately in at least some dbmss e g postgres hsdb the results of those calls are not the same and are less accurate than the sqlmetadata getcolumns call used in columnstab to get the column info even more unfortunate is the fact that the set of attributes reported on by the two calls is not the same with the resultsetmetadata listing things not provided by getcolumns most of the data provided by the resultsetmetadata calls is correct however the nullable not nullable property is not set correctly in at least two dbmss while it is correct for those dbmss in the getcolumns info therefore we collect the collumn nullability information from getcolumns and pass that info to the resultset to override what it got from the resultsetmetadata
SQu,positive,the utility class that reads and writes release info from to the release xml file todo spring inject when this class is a spring bean
SQu,positive,todo this wo not work when the column has values with quotes in them use preparedstatements instead hmmm instead of insert statements could we not just create a sequence and generate a select statement that a uses the sequence for the pkid b selects distinct values that would be a more efficient approach that would also eliminate this quoting problem
SQu,positive,the following only works if swingutilities getroot table returns and instanceof basemdiparentframe if swingtuilities getroot table returns and instance of dialog or frame then other code must be used
SQu,positive,need to somehow call sqlresultexecuterpanel rerunselectedresulttab true something like sqlresultexecuterpanel panel getpanel panel rerunselectedresulttab true however that does not apply when the user is exporting from the table contents table there needs to be a more generic way to do this for all tables containing data that is to be exported where some of the fields contain placeholders for now we just inform the user and let them either continue or abort and change the configuration manually re run the query reload the table data and re export

SQu,positive,we set expected and checksum to here since we do not have that information for release xml file todo can httpclient be used to get the byte size of release xml so we can perform this check ?
SQu,positive,here i do not completely understand how these types are to be used in all databases and i have not yet had time to implement support in the dialects for them so this exclude list will keep these less commonly used types from failing the test also since not all of these types appear in java and we currently support compiling the code base with it i use the integer values for new types that were introduces in java rather than the type constant name
SQu,positive,todo delete this class unused
SQu,positive,todo find out why kludge for some reason i am not able to get the sheet to size correctly it always displays with a size that causes the sub panels to have their scrollbars showing add a bit of an increase in the size of the panel so the scrollbars are not displayed
SQu,positive,copied from java doc matcher replaceall note that backslashes and dollar signs in the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it were being treated as a literal replacement string dollar signs may be treated as references to captured subsequences as described above and backslashes are used to escape literal characters in the replacement string

SQu,positive,should the data be first cloned so that the sorting does not take place on the array that is used in getvalue todo this is a must if sorting is done in a thread ? ?

SQu,positive,set the property values note this may have already been done by another instance of this datatype created to handle a different column
SQu,positive,drop fk constraints before dropping any tables otherwise we may drop the child table prior to dropping it is fks which would be an error todo this should be done in the dialect is gettabledropsql method for a database specific handling or ignoring of this problem
SQu,positive,silently ignore what could we do anyway ?
SQu,positive,this is a bit hard coded but if we use scale here some number displays go crazy
SQu,positive,todo figure out why the selection of the root node in the object tree is undone if we do not delay it seems like some other thread racing to set the selected node to none when this happens the detail pane for the root node disappears when a session is first opened or when an objecttree frame is created this is a really crappy and unreliable way to fix this problem but it hides the problem for now a better understanding of the architecture of session creation is required before a proper solution can be attempted rmm 
SQu,positive,todo temporary until we sort out a better way to do guido is fix assertequals second stmt sep qt getsqlstatementseparator

SQu,positive,check the error stream for a problem this is a bit questionable since it is possible for processes to output something on stderr but continue processing but without this some problems are not seen e g bad argument type messages from the process
SQu,positive,ok this is a hack currently when precision scale i have no way to determine if this is valid for the actual data the problem comes when the source db is precision scale are greater or reported to be greater than the precision scale of the destination db in this case it maximimizes both for the destination causing a definition that allows digits to the left of the decimal trouble is without looking at the actual data there is no way to tell if this is valid in some cases it will be ok in others it will not be ok so for now make the scale be approx one half of the precision to accomodate the most digits to the left and right of the decimal and hopefully that covers the majority of cases

SQu,positive,this is a logically not sufficent try to cope with the problem that there are the following contradictory rules in the jdbc api doc statement getresultset this method should be called only once per result statement getupdatecount this method should be called only once per result statement getmoreresults there are no more results when the following is true getmoreresults getupdatecount if getmoreresults returns false we do not know if we have more results we only know that it is not a result set since we called getupdatecount before getmoreresults because we would like to know the update count of the first result we might not be allowed to call getupdatecount again the intersystems cache driver for example always returns the same updatecount on simple insert update delete statements not matter if getmoreresults was called so updatecount never gets and this will loop forever when i discussed the issue with the intersystems people they just told me not to call getupdatecount twice that simple my hope is that this will cure problems with dbs that just do not care for multiple result sets

SQu,positive,unfortunately we need to remove the exising tree table component and create a new one due to limitations with replacing models in the existing sun implementation why on earth they couldnt formalise the tree table example on jfc which we use a bit more is anyones guess
SQu,positive,todo figure out why bind variables are not working
SQu,positive,todo make properties file application properties so we can use class name to generate properties file name
SQu,positive,hack hopefully the fk name will always be the last token

SQu,positive,todo spring inject when this class is a spring bean
SQu,positive,todo make parameter implement sqlitem interface which has a getstring method which can also be implemented by sqlstring or sqlfragment or some such we can then eliminate the use of instanceof below and clean up the code a bit by making itemsinsql look like arraylist sqlitem itemsinsql new arraylist sqlitem
SQu,positive,todo spring inject when this class is a spring bean
SQu,positive,h uses java classes that implement the trigger interface to operate on database tables rows when an action triggers them therefore there is currently no way to access the source for a trigger hopefully this will change at some point in the future treeapi adddetailtab databaseobjecttype trigger new triggersourcetab the source of the trigger
SQu,positive,? ? split these functions off into a subclass of basefavouriteaction
SQu,positive,arrays of strings are a special case in xmlbeanwriter method processproperty an array of strings is turned into a list of stringwrapper objects in the xml presumably so that when reading them back we have a class that we can call setters on thus when reading back an array of strings we actually read an array of stringwrappers which gives a type mis match in the following arraycopy therefore we need to convert the data that is currently in the stringwrapper objects into actual strings

SQu,positive,db delete worked correctly so now delete from table important the user and the creator both work through the sortabletablemodel not the actual model thus the row indexes to delete are given in the sortabletablemodel row numbers so we must work through that model model to actually do the delete
SQu,positive,set the property values note this may have already been done by another instance of this datatype created to handle a different column
SQu,positive,todo do we need this one
SQu,positive,todo figure out a more reliable way to handle other type which indicates a database specific type
SQu,positive,todo is giving a fk constraint a name universally supported and done the same way on every database ?
SQu,positive,todo javadoc author colin bell

SQu,negative,datatypes may limit the initial data read from the db e g to minimize the time needed for the initial load of the table to edit the contents of a cell we require that the entire contents of the data element be present in the cell before editing therefore we ask the datatype if we need to re read the data contents without limiting it and do that read if needed if there is a problem during the read e g we cannot identify exactly one row in the db matching the current row in the table then the cell is not editable the reverse is not true if we succeed in reading the data there may still be other reasons why we cannot edit it so we need to check for it being editable after the read

SQu,negative,for oracle g we could say something like where xmlserialize content coldef getlabel like   value   this does not appear to work on oracle i at the moment so we will avoid using this column in any where clause if the value is non null which is what the superclass implementation does todo find a way to do this for both versions or split this behavior so that it works on g and is disabled on i

SQu,negative,unfortunately conversion to uppercase does not work properly for the georgian alphabet which has strange rules about case conversion so we need to make one last check before exiting

SQu,negative,if the release version does not change we wo not be pulling down core artifacts so we just need to make sure that all core files have been copied from their installed locations into the corresponding directory in download which is in the classpath of the updater this covers the case where the update is being run for the first time after install and no new version is available but the user wants to install remove plugins and or translations
SQu,negative,drop the existing default value alter table tablename alter columnname drop default

SQu,negative,default behavior if no appropriate data type found is to create a simple jtextarea with no special handling in theory this cannot happen because if there is no data type object for this column is data type then iseditableinpopup returns false so we should not get here if there is a data type object and iseditableinpopup returns true then we would have executed the return statement above assume that the value can be represented as a string

SQu,negative,postgresql follows the standard for sql bit it is a string of bits so bit is a string of bits jdbc treats sql bit as if it were only a single bit it specifies that bit is equivalent to boolean it claims that the preparedstatement set method that should be used with bit is setboolean and getboolean this is not compliant with the standard so sql bit type support is broken in java there is nothing we can do about that best thing to do for now is try to convert the bit type to a boolean like the jdbc spec says and hope for the best hope that the source database is not using the bit column as a sequence of multiple bits

SQu,negative,clobs are different from normal data types in that what is actually read from the db is a descriptor pointing to the data rather than the data itself during the initial load of the table the values read from the descriptor may have been limited but the descriptor itself has been completely read therefore we do not need to re read the datum from the database because we know that we have the entire descriptor if the contents of the clob have been limited during the initial table load that will be discovered when we check if the cell is editable and the full data will be read at that time using this descriptor

SQu,negative,user enters something when field is null
SQu,negative,value is a simple string representation of the data but not the same one used in the text and in cell operations the in cell version may replace newline chars with n while this version does not in other respects it is the same as the in cell version because both use the renderer object to do the rendering

SQu,negative,now the popup related methods these are not quite symmetric with the in cell calls because the conversion of the object into the text to display in the popup is handled internally to the datatype object inside getjtextarea so we do not need a renderobjectinpopup function visible to the rest of the world

SQu,negative,since we can use a correlated sub query to update all rows in one statement we do not care about the set values unless fromtables is null in which case we go with a normal update using the set values would require an update statement for each row in the merged table for each column that was merged in which is incredibly inefficient however the api is intended to support database dialects that ca not handle correlated sub queries
