Arg,positive,the part of the design this issue affects p each member is either a model element  a link fig  or a link diagram p todo offenders need to be more strongly typed because there is not a common supertype for these three types  we ca not type this list we should introduce a common supertype interface tfm  p the list of offenders is set once  e g by the constructor  and cannot change p
Arg,positive,reply a set of design material is that are the subject of this todoitem return the offenders todo offenders need to be more strongly typed tfm 
Arg,positive,todo this could be a huge collection find a more efficient way
Arg,positive,todo generalize assumes uml type names are unique without the qualifying package names true for uml  
Arg,positive,models the designers goals in making this design provides useful control information to the agency so that only critics relevant to the designers goals are ever executed todo really this should be part of a domain extension and not the kernel i have not developed this part of argo very much author jason robbins
Arg,positive,todo do we need to worry about umlclass  umlpackage  etc ?
Arg,positive,todo this should fetch the stereotype from our profile
Arg,positive,todo encountering a deleted object during any part of this traversal will abort the rest of the traversal we probably should do the whole traversal in a single mdr transaction

Arg,positive,changed in uml component with subsystem stereotype todo we should deprecate this ?
Arg,positive,returns the root package return the package which is the root deprecated for  by tfmorris use link getroots to get packages model elements which are at the top level p todo we probably need a getdefaultnamespace method or something similar to replace some uses of this
Arg,positive,updates the top level modelelements for all projects in uml  each model knows it is root elements  so this could make setroots obsolete e g  applying a stereotype in uml adds a new root todo this is redundant with setroots getroots there are already too many ways this stuff is managed without adding an additional one all current model subsystem implementations know their top level elements responsibility can be moved to the model subsystem  but let is choose one way of managing this
Arg,positive,a datastructure for settings for a project p most getters return a string  since they are used by argo tee this is also the reason all these attributes are not part of a map or something p todo the header comment is currently not used this function is not completely implemented yet how do we store this in the project ? where should the user enter his header comment ? see issue  author michiel
Arg,positive,notation settings value object stores settings which control how text is rendered on diagrams p todo this needs to go on a diet it is used everywhere  so is performance sensitive the current set of settings is the union of all those found in the legacy code  but it is not clear that all of them are actually used author tom morris tfmorris gmail com
Arg,positive,this does a calculation of where our ext directory is todo we should eventually make sure that this calculation is only present in one place in the code and not several
Arg,positive,in contrast to link getzipname returns the member is name without the prepended name of the project  but with the extension  p todo this is not used anywhere shall we remove it ? author steffen zschaler return the member is name without any prefix or suffix

Arg,positive,todo addonly has been removed in uml  x  so we should phase out support of it tfm 
Arg,positive,save the argo entry todo cyclic dependency with persistencemanager move persistencemanager getprojectbasename someplace else
Arg,positive,if c is empty  then we 're done  or there is a cycle in the message graph  which would be bad  if c has more than one element  then the model is crappy  but we will just use one of them anyway
Arg,positive,utility method to encode a string in a way that allows it to be saved properly in an xml file and regained filtering out any noice that an xml framework might have seen fit to add todo why are we doing this ourselves ? surely encoding information for xml serialization is a well known task tfm i have never understood why this is being done i think we should remove any usage bob param str the string to encode return the encoded string

Arg,positive,todo we really want to be able replace the initial content handler which is passed to sax  but we ca not do this without cloning a whole bunch of code because it is private in the super class
Arg,positive,if no fig was created by the code above then we must go look for the old style constructor that should have fallen into disuse by now fig  object  rectangle  diagramsettings  all of these constructors should have been deprecated at least and replaced with the new signature this is here for paranoia only until all figs have been reviewed
Arg,positive,a fignodemodelelement with no owner should match here todo this is a temporary solution due to figpool extending fignodemodelelement when in fact it should not do so
Arg,positive,todo move to gef
Arg,positive,translate the visibility flag of a fig to the pgml visibility attribute value the pgml values are  hidden and  shown if not specified then  is the default so we return null for this to prevent redundent data being written to pgml todo remove on gef release after  as it will be provided there param f the fig return  hidden  null shown

Arg,positive,this class represents a pool of swimlanes for activity diagrams this is exists only to act as the gef style encloser other nodes in the same must be placed entirely within or outside the boundaries of this fig but cannot intersect with the boundary p todo there is no actual model element being represented here so we are inheriting a lot of behaviour from fignodemodelelement that we do not want we require to split fignodemodelelement to separate the code that requires a model element owner see issue p remark mvw why not give it an owner instead ? the activitygraph is the obvious candidate  or maybe the top state author mkl

Arg,positive,a command to set selected figs to their minimum size p despite its name  really the minimum size is selected here  p todo rename this class author markus klink
Arg,positive,this fig is never placed on a diagram it is only used by the call renderer so that pick list items look like diagram figs todo this fig does not represent a model element and so it should not extend fignodemodelelement we should split fignodemodelelement in two  one for base functionality for all nodes and one that is truly for model elements
Arg,positive,todo why is this code even getting called for a figgeneralization ?

Arg,positive,todo we definitely do not want to react to addition and removal of transitions ca not we be more specific when we register ourselves as a listener
Arg,positive,the target model element in uml x this is the element that owns the expression in uml x this is the expression itself todo this makes behaviour different enough that separate subclasses should be considered

Arg,positive,get all classifiers in our model todo we need the property panels to have some reference to the project they belong to instead of using deprecated functionality
Arg,positive,todo copied from umldiagramrenderer get the fignode from the given layer that represents the given model element the fignode portion of an association class is returned in preference to the figedge portion if no fignode is found then a figedge is searched for and the fignode that acts as its edge port is returned param lay the layer containing the fig param modelelement the model element to find presentation for return the fignode presentation of the model element

Arg,positive,todo this is well formedness rule from uml  no generalizableelement can have a parent generalization to an element that is a leaf self parent forall  s not s isleaf

Arg,positive,todo add standard stereotype ? set is open ended  but predefined names include call  create  instantiate  send
Arg,positive,todo is there anyway we can determine this size at runtime ?
Arg,positive,todo taken from figclassifierboxwithattribute to handle events on an attribute all this event handling should eventually be moved to the compartment fig for attributes
Arg,positive,we are getting events we do not want filter them out todo can we instruct the model event pump not to send these in the first place ? see defect  param event the event
Arg,positive,modelimpl getfacade getrootelements gets all root elements in the uml repository  including available profiles that are not part of the current project  degrades performance  projectmanager getmanager getcurrentproject getroots only returns user model roots  and no profiles projectmanager getmanager getcurrentproject getmodels gets all root models  but no root namespaces todo which is best ? is there any other way ?
Arg,positive,todo as currently coded  this actually returns all behavioralfeatures which are owned by classifiers contained in the given namespace  which is slightly different then what is documented it will not include any behavioralfeatures which are part of the namespace  but which do not have an owner
Arg,positive,todo performance consider instantiating this just once outside the for loops and clear at this point instead
Arg,positive,delete a model element implements 'cascading delete' to make sure model is still valid after element has been deleted p the actual deletion is delegated to delete methods in the rest of the factories for example a method deleteclass exists on corehelper delete methods as deleteclass should only do those extra actions that are necessary for the deletion of the modelelement itself i e deleteclass should only take care of things specific to umlclass p the delete methods in the uml factories should not be called directly throughout the code  calls should always refer to this method and never call the deletexxx method on xxxfactory directly the reason that it is possible to call the deletexxx methods directly is a pure implementation detail p the implementation of this method uses a quite complicated if then else tree this is done to provide optimal performance and full compliance to the uml metamodel the last remark refers to the fact that the uml model uses multiple inheritance in several places this has to be taken into account p todo the requirements of the metamodel could probably be better determined by reflection on the metamodel then each association that a deleted element participates in could be reviewed to make sure that it meets the requirements and  if not  be deleted tfm p extensions and its children are not taken into account here they do not require extra cleanup actions not in the form of a call to the remove method as is normal for all children of mbase and not in the form of other behaviour we want to implement via this operation param elem the element to be deleted see org argouml model umlfactory delete  java lang object
Arg,positive,do not allow connections to be created from a read only model element to any other todo this should be considered a workaround it only works because  by default  we place newly created relationships in the namespace of the fromelement the correct behavior in the presence of read only elements really depends on the type of connection as well as the writeability of both ends
Arg,positive,todo taken from figclassifierboxwithattribute to handle events on an attribute all this event handling should eventually be moved to the compartment fig for attributes
Arg,positive,an array of valid connections  the combination of connecting class and node classes must exist as a row in this list to be considered valid ul li the st column is the connecting element li the nd column is the from element type li the rd column is the to element type the rd column is optional  if not given then it is assumed to be the same as the from element li the existence of a th column indicates that the connection is valid in one direction only ul todo this encodes not only what is legal in uml  but also what argouml knows how to create  so not all legal connections are included probably should be split into two pieces legal uml  here  and supported  in argouml application someplace  tfm  p see also issue  p most of these are subtypes of relationship which includes association  dependency  flow  generalization  extend  and include dependency includes binding  abstraction  usage  and permission associationrole and associationclass are associations the remaining items  link  transition  associationend  message  are non relationship types which argouml treats as connections edges
Arg,positive,todo check for duplicates  is this possible ? ? ?
Arg,positive,todo we also have code registering for the names of a tagged value like derived
Arg,positive,recursive method to get all subtypes todo does this have a scalability problem ?
Arg,positive,todo bob says we should not be listening here for addition and removal of attributes this should be done in figattributescompartment
Arg,positive,do not wait on ourselves  we will deadlock  todo we might want to throw an exception here
Arg,positive,todo must we calculate the whole list ?
Arg,positive,todo replace this recursive function by a loop like in getroot
Arg,positive,todo because we get called on each and every change event  when the model is in a state of flux  we will often get an invalidelementexception before we finish this collection the only saving grace is that we 're called so many times that on the last time  things should be stable again and we will get a good set of elements for the final update we need a better mechanism
Arg,positive,updates a compartment box called from updatelayout if there is a model event effecting the attributes operations and from renderingchanged in all cases todo the above statement means that the entire contents of the compartments are being rebuilt whenever an add remove of an attribute  operation or a reception is detected it would be better to have compartments listen for add and remove events and make minimum change rather than entirely rebuild remark mvw this is a bit exaggerated  since the populate method is already heavily optimized
Arg,positive,todo reconfigure exception handling to distinguish between errors that are possible due to bad input data and those that represent unexpected processing errors
Arg,positive,todo callers will need to be refactored to work around the change in the way multiplicities work tfm
Arg,positive,and its stereotypes todo are not stereotypes handled elsewhere ?
Arg,positive,todo because we get called on each and every change event  when the model is in a state of flux  we will often get an invalidelementexception before we finish this collection the only saving grace is that we 're called so many times that on the last time  things should be stable again and we will get a good set of elements for the final update we need a better mechanism
Arg,positive,todo some elements such as generalization are no longer named for a transitional period we will return a string so debug can continue  but the calling code should probably be fixed tfm  bob says these are the comments that were in facadeeumlimpl getname same trick is needed here for now
Arg,positive,map of which resources are read only p todo this needs to be managed per editingdomain
Arg,positive,todo mvw would it not be better if this code would go in starttexteditor  not overruling mouseclicked but we made this fig not editable  to stop it from reacting on key presses anyhow this is a hack abusing a figtext gef does not really support double clicking on a fig to trigger some action
Arg,positive,todo does corehelper getextendingclassifiers  object element  means all direct and indirect extending classifiers or only the direct extending classifiers ?
Arg,positive,todo this code appears to be designed to jump to the diagram containing the contents of the package that was double clicked but it looks like it is always searching for the name main instead of the package name todo but in any case  it should be delegating this work to to something that knows about the diagrams and they contents tfm
Arg,positive,todo what is the behavior of this in the case of nested models ?
Arg,positive,todo is this returning extended elements or base classes ?
Arg,positive,todo instancespecification classifier association is not navigable in this direction
Arg,positive,a model element has been removed from this packages namespace if the fig representing that model element is on the same diagram as this package then make sure it is not enclosed by this package todo in my view the fig representing the model element should be removed from the diagram yet to be agreed bob
Arg,positive,todo seems to work only with both loops  check why
Arg,positive,todo this needs to be double checked tfm
Arg,positive,used by pgml tee return the class name and bounds together with compartment visibility todo is this not duplicate with the parent ?
Arg,positive,this node cannot be dragged and manipulated in the same way as other fignodes in argouml it is actually an optional child fig  or more precisely a path item  of a figedgemodelelement this allows the dashed edge of an association class to connect the association edge and allows the dashed edge of a comment edge to attach a comment to some other edge type gef can only attach edges to nodes  by making this fig both a node and containing it as a child of an edge we push the rules to allow edge to edge connections todo we are inheriting a lot of functionality here that we do not really require we should attempt to make figedgeport extend fignode author bob tarling
Arg,positive,todo this is a temporary crutch to use until all figs are updated to use the constructor that accepts a diagramsettings object
Arg,positive,searches for a stereotype just like the given stereotype in all given models  and their sub namespaces  the given stereotype can not have its namespace set yet otherwise it will be returned itself  todo this function should not take a stereotype object as parameter  but a name and a baseclass p todo currently only works for stereotypes with only one baseclass p todo should it only search for stereotypes owned by the model object ? param models a collection of models param stereo is the given stereotype return stereotype
Arg,positive,finds a stereotype in a given namespace  and all those in any sub namespace of the given namespace returns null if no such stereotype is found p todo what if stereo getname or stereo getbaseclass is null ? then you know immediately that none will be found  but is that the correct answer ? currently  null is returned in these cases p todo this function should not take a stereotype object as parameter  but a name and a baseclass p todo currently only works for stereotypes with only one baseclass p todo currently only works for stereotypes where the baseclass is equal to the given one inheritance does not work return the stereotype found or null param ns is the namespace param stereo is the stereotype
Arg,positive,creates a uml model element of the given type this only works for uml elements if a diagram contains elements of another type then it is the responsibility of the diagram manage those items and not call this method it also only works for uml model elements that are represented in diagrams by a node param elementtype the type of model element to build return the model element todo this needs an extra parameter to specify the model extent where the new element should be created
Arg,positive,builds a compositestate as top for some statemachine p todo confusing name this method should better be named buildtopstateonstatemachine param statemachine the given statemachine return mcompositestate the newly build top state see buildcompositestate  object
Arg,positive,todo mvw this needs rethinking rework  i have the following questions why does it not search for a stereotype in the namespace using properties and only create a new stereotype if it will actually be used ? ie  why is there not a getstereotype  string name  string baseclass  ?  edited by dmst
Arg,positive,todo this functionality is in the worn place we should be able to call setvisible on the compartment itself and then this class should react to that event improvements will follow in later releases hence this method should not be considered stable for module developers param compartment the compartment to be changed param isvisible true if the attribute compartment is visible
Arg,positive,todo this should become private and only called from constructor see org argouml uml diagram ui figcompartment populate
Arg,positive,remove all items in the group  otherwise the model event listeners remain todo why does a figgroup not do this ?
Arg,positive,todo in uml  classifierrole  associationrole  and associationendrole have been replaced by the internal structure of the collaboration
Arg,positive,todo the above populate works but seems rather heavy here i can see something like this is needed though as events wo not manage this quick enough could we make figeditablecompartment createmodelelement create the new child fig instance ? it may also be useful for it to return the new model element rather than the current void return bob
Arg,positive,todo is this needed correct ? for when all compartments are hidden ?
Arg,positive,this tag is set on elements that are generated by reference when importing if it is set  then the critics could ignore those objects if they want todo this is really belongs in a higher level utility class that uses the facade is tagged value methods also  it needs to be updated to use a uml tagdefinition instead of a simple string
Arg,positive,recognizer for n ary association todo this is not a recognizer for some type rename to isnaryassociation ? param handle candidate return true if handle is an association
Arg,positive,todo is this needed ?
Arg,positive,builds an interface with a given name param name is the given name return interface todo this needs an extra parameter to specify the model extent where the new element should be created

Arg,positive,returns the destination of a relation or link the destination of a relation is defined as the modelelement that receives this relation if there are more then  destinations  only the first is returned if there is no destination  null is returned examples of sources include classifiers that are types to associationends  usecases that are bases to extend and include relations and so on in the case of an association  the destination is defined as the type of the second element in the connections list p todo move this method to a generic modelhelper param relationship is the relation return object
Arg,positive,return the source of a relation or link the source of a relation is defined as the modelelement that propagates this relation if there are more then  sources  only the first is returned if there is no source  null is returned examples of sources include classifiers that are types to associationends  usecases that are bases to extend and include relations and so on a source is always the start from the arrow in the fig  the destination the end p todo move this method to a generic modelhelper param relationship is the relation return object
Arg,positive,sets the language of an expression todo this operation is fooling the user in thinking that the body of the object is changed instead  a new object is created there is no other way a mexpression can not be altered  once created  so  this operation returns a newly created object instead param handle the expression param language the new language return the newly created object
Arg,positive,todo remove the casting to diagramfactoryinterface as soon as diagramfactoryinterface is removed
Arg,positive,todo having critics actions here introduces an unnecessary dependency on the critics subsystem have it register its desired actions using an extension mechanism tfm

Arg,positive,find a model element in modelelements which name is equal to name param name the name of the model element to find it ca not be null param modelelements the link collection of model elements in which to find a model element with name return the model element if found or null todo maybe should be moved to a helper class that deals with model related stuff
Arg,positive,todo we should really set up our own profile instead of depending on the default this depends on the default profile configuration containing the type integer to test properly otherwise it will get created in the main project  defeating the purpose
Arg,positive,called by propertychanged when it detects that a stereotype has been added or removed on removal the fignode removes its listener to that stereotype when a new stereotype is detected we add a listener todo bob says in my opinion we should not be doing this here figstereotype should always be listening to change of its owners name figstereotypescompartment should always be listening for add or remove of stereotypes to its owner those classes will need to pass some event to the fignode on the awt thread only if a change results in a change of size that requires a redraw p note runs at the model  mdr  thread p param event the umlchangeevent that caused the change
Arg,positive,todo do we want the top level package here instead of the immediate parent ?
Arg,positive,todo this creates a dependency on the critics subsystem we need a generic way for modules  including our internal subsystems  to request addition of actions to the popup menu tfm 
Arg,positive,this is a template method called by the argouml framework as the result of a change to a model element do not call this method directly yourself p override this in any subclasses in order to change what model elements the fignode is listening to as a result of change to the model p p this method is guaranteed by the framework to be running on the same thread as the model subsystem p todo lets refactor this at some time to take umlchangeevent argument param event the umlchangeevent that caused the change

Arg,positive,fix up bad figs p due to errors in earlier releases of argouml it can happen that there is a generalization without a child or parent p todo move into xsl we should not remove from the graph model while we 're writing to it or we have a possible cause of concurrent modification exception param owner
Arg,positive,todo the above does not work reliably in a constructor we need a better way of getting default fig settings for the owning project rather than using the project manager singleton tfm
Arg,positive,defines the methods to generate source code from the model each class providing code generation functionality must implement this to be recognized by argouml as a code generator p todo a gui independent mechanism to pass settings to the code generator is needed similar to what we have for reverse engineering see link org argouml uml reveng importinterface getimportsettings and link org argouml uml reveng settingstypes since when it replaced the filegenerator interface

Arg,positive,p determines if the figedge is currently connected to the correct fignodes  if not the edges is the correct fignodes set and the edge rerouted p typically this is used when a user has amended from the property panel a relationship from one model element to another and the graph needs to react to that change p e g if the participant of an association end is changed p calls a helper method  layoutthistoself  to avoid this edge disappearing if the new source and dest are the same node todo this method is called far too frequently it should only be called when a specific event is received it seems to be currently called whenever any event is received from the owner return boolean whether or not the update was sucessful

Arg,positive,once all edges are connected do a compute route on each to make sure that annotations and the edge port is positioned correctly only do this after all edges are connected as compute route requires all edges to be connected to nodes todo it would be nice not to have to do this and restore annotation positions instead
Arg,positive,todo move to gef

Arg,positive,method assign data immediately  see end of file  todo if we ever want to extend pathitemplacement  we should modify this  so that we also recognise any subclass of pathitemplacement is the class name a pathitemplacment ? todo use class reference to make this dependency obvious

Arg,positive,finds a type in a model by name fixme duplicated from the method with the same name in org argouml profile internal modelutils param s the type name param model the model return the type or code null code if the type has not been found
Arg,positive,this class manages the projects loaded in argouml  and what the current project is p classes in argouml can ask this class for the current project and set the current project since we only have one project in argouml at the moment  this class does not manage a list of projects like one would expect this could be a nice extension for the future of argouml as soon as the current project is changed  a property changed event is fired p todo move everything related to the creation of a project into the projectfactory since nov  author jaap branderhorst xsall nl stereotype singleton
Arg,positive,todo is this used in places other than on diagrams ? if so  it needs to stay in projectsettings  as well as being a diagramsetting  return returns code true code if we show stereotypes in the explorer
Arg,positive,throws saxexception when things go wrong with sax throws ioexception when there is an io error throws parserconfigurationexception when the parser finds wrong syntax todo unused ?
Arg,positive,since this is  hopefully  a temporary solution  and nobody ever looks at the type of notation event  we can simplify from sending every existing event to one event only but since there is no catch all event defined  we just make one up rationale reduce the number of total refreshes of the drawing
Arg,positive,prefix identified as an implementation specific class todo this should be generalized so it does not have to be changed each time a new implementation is created tfm 
Arg,positive,todo this is temporary we need a new list for uml  x the following uml elements are not in uml  x
Arg,positive,todo this is currently just a mechanical merge of the tests in from the generic model test and the nsuml tests they need to be reviewed merged author euluis since  version  
Arg,positive,finds a classifier with a certain name p will only return first classifier with the matching name todo move to model subsystem tfm  param s is short name param ns namespace where we do the search return the found classifier  or code null code if not found
Arg,positive,the uml  x package structure is entirely different  so we have to remap a bunch of stuff names without embedded colons indicate that the entire package is remapped e g kernel core as a matter of fact the only package which did not get renamed or moved is usecases todo this section is very incomplete tfm

Arg,positive,the project interface encapsulates all information about a designer is project it contains the list of diagrams and uml models  various project properties such as the author is name  and defaults for various settings p todo this interface was mechanically refactored from the implementation class link projectimpl it needs to be reviewed and cleaned up  eliminating methods which should be part of the public api and splitting the interface into smaller function specific  e g trashcan  interfaces author tom morris tfmorris gmail com  thomas neustupny since  when it replaced the concrete class of the same name
Arg,positive,todo this should listen for new target events fired by wizstep updatetabtodo so that we can decouple it from the projectbrowser
Arg,positive,todo should fire its own event and projectbrowser todo should register a listener
Arg,positive,agency manages critics since classes are not really first class objects in java  a singleton instance of agency is made and passed around as needed the agency keeps a registry of all critics that should be applied to each type of design material when a design material instance is critiqued it asks agency to apply all registered critic is in the current scheme there is a thread that proactively  continuously critiques the design at hand  even if the user is idle  this is simple and it works the disadvantage is that all active critics related to a given design material are applied  regardless of the reason for the critiquing and a lot of cpu time is basically wasted p todo i am moving toward a more reactionary scheme in which specific design manipulations in the editor cause critics relevant to those manipulations to be applied this transition is still half done triggers are the critiquing requests the code for triggers is currently dormant  latent ?  p todo there is a strong dependency cycle between agency and designer they either need to be merged into a single class or partitioned differently  perhaps using an interface to break the cycle the designer singleton gets passed to almost every single part of the critic subsystem  creating strong coupling throughout tfm  author jason robbins
Arg,positive,reply true iff this critic is relevant to the goals that the designer is trying to achieve by default  all critic is are relevant regardless of the goalmodel really this is something for a controlmech to compute  but if a subclass of critic encapsulates some information you may need to override this method p todo i would like a better default action  but goals are typed and their values must be interpreted by critics they are not as generic as the decisionmodel param dsgr the designer return true if relevant
Arg,positive,todo this is a hack a much better way of doing this would be not to start the critic in the first place
Arg,positive,return true iff the given todoitem is still valid and should be kept in the given designers todolist critics that are not enabled should always return false so that their todoitems will be removed subclasses of critic that supply multiple offenders should always override this method p by default this method basically asks the critic to again critique the offending object and then it checks if the resulting todoitem is the same as the one already posted this is simple and it works fine for light weight critics critics that expend a lot of computational effort in making feedback that can be easily check to see if it still holds  should override this method p todo maybe todoitem should carry some data to make this method more efficient inheritdoc
Arg,positive,the decisionmodel is part of the state of the designer it describes what types of decisions  or design issues  the designer is thinking about at the current time critics that are relevant to those decisions are made active  critics that are not relevant are made inactive todo there is some notion that each decision has a certain importanance at a certain time  but i have not followed through on that because i do not have good examples of how to quantify the importance of a decision todo right now the individual decisions are just strings  maybe they should have some non atomic structure ? author jason robbins
Arg,positive,how much control should critics have over when they are relavant ? does doing that in code instead of declaratively limit reasoning ? how does using more semantically rich method calls impact componentization ?
Arg,positive,this class models the designer who is building a complex design in some application domain and needs continuous feedback to aid in the making of good design decisions p strong this area needs work  especially as it is a central idea of argo strong p currently  almost  everything is hardcoded what can be configurable ? ? p the todolist is dependent on this class  i e each designer has its todolist p each designer has his own agency  which is the only class that knows all the critics p this class listens to property changes from ? p a designer can create todo items  just like the critics hence the designer implements the poster interface p todo there is a strong dependency cycle between agency and designer they either need to be merged into a single class or partitioned differently  perhaps using an interface to break the cycle the designer singleton gets passed to almost every single part of the critic subsystem  creating strong coupling throughout tfm  author jason robbins
Arg,positive,return the default type for a parameter return a classifier to use as the default type todo this belongs in projectsettings tfm
Arg,positive,todo at the moment setselectedcomponent does not take into account the rather complex tab selection mechanism of detailspane the tab selection mechanism must be refactored
Arg,positive,todoitems that the designer has explicitly indicated that  s  he considers resolved p todo generalize into a design rationale logging facility
Arg,positive,todo settext in gef should call setbounds instead of directly changing x  y  w  h then we will have an event generated correctly in gef

Arg,positive,andreas this is just temporary for the uml pre alpha versions
Arg,positive,sets the body of an expression todo this operation is fooling the user in thinking that the body of the object is changed instead  a new object is created there is no other way a mexpression can not be altered  once created  so  this operation returns a newly created object instead param handle the expression to modify param body the body to set return the newly created expression

Arg,positive,todo note copy paste code in figexitpoint where is this code better placed in gef ?
Arg,positive,this is a temporary hack until the notation provider for a sd message will be able to parse successfully when the sequence number is missing remove this method completely then
Arg,positive,todo calcbounds is called by selectionmanager when the fig is dragged this code is needed to reposition any self message as they are become detached from their classifier role  see issue the cause of the detachment is not yet understood unfortunately calcbounds is called from several other places so the code here is not optimal but is the best workaround until argouml can provide its own replacement selectionmanager for sequence diagram requirements see http gef tigris org issues show bug cgi ? id 
Arg,positive,workaround for missing ability to parse
Arg,positive,the default behaviour from figedgemodelelement is not correct here see issue  todo we must determine what to do here but for now doing nothing is better i'm not sure why the super method would not work as i would expect that to do nothing if the ends are already correct return true at all times for now
Arg,positive,create an empty but initialized instance of a uml parameter return an initialized uml parameter instance todo this needs an extra parameter to specify the model extent where the new element should be created
Arg,positive,convert to bounding box very screwy  gef sometimes uses center and sometimes upper left todo gef also positions text at the nominal baseline which is well inside the bounding box and gives the overall size incorrectly
Arg,positive,this is the interface for registering interest in events sent from the model component p neither the registration or unregistration  nor the events themselves contain any reference to the model implementation instead they use the link java beans propertychangelistener  link java beans propertychangeevent to deliver events p the reference to the listener is a weakreference so you do not need to call removewhateverlistener  you can just forget about your listener and it is eventually finalized and removed this also means that you will have to keep a reference to your listener while it is active since the garbage collecting mechanism is not really deterministic a forgotten about listener might still receive events unless it can handle them in a harmless way  this approach should not be used todo  is this still true or does it refer to the nsuml implementation ? tfm  this is part of the contract that is established between the model subsystem and its users if that is not fulfilled by the current implementation  then the current implementation is incorrect linus p todo what event names ? the event names generated are link string s and their values and meanings are not really well documented in general they are the name of an an association end or attribute in the uml metamodel p here are some highlights ul li remove event sent when the element is removed ul author linus tolke

Arg,positive,recognizer for primary objects a primary object is an object that is created by the parser or by a user object that are created as a side effect of importing some other object are not p todo this does not belong in the facade it is a higher level function used specifically for certain reverse engineering operations tfmorris param handle candidate return true if primary object
Arg,positive,todo this is a temporary crutch to use until all figs are updated to use the constructor that accepts a diagramsettings object
Arg,positive,recognizer for parameter is with a directionkind of return todo this is a duplicate of link hasreturnparameterdirectionkind  object  param handle candidate parameter return true if handle is a return parameter

Arg,positive,return the tagged value with a specific tag p warning this method returns only the first taggedvalue found with the given name hence  this method is a simplification of the real problem and should be avoided todo what should be done about the above problem ? options are to deprecate the method  throw an exception if the name is ambiguous  or leave the caller to figure it out themselves param handle the model element the tagged value belongs to param name the tag name return the found tag  null if not found
Arg,positive,todo is this removed from uml ?
Arg,positive,todo some of these magic numbers probably assume a line width of  replace with appropriate constants variables
Arg,positive,todo this needs to be managed on a per project or per model extent basis
Arg,positive,returns all states that can be recursively contained by the given state p todo link getallpossiblesubvertices  object  and link getallsubstates  object  are duplicates as implemented for mdr it is not clear from the javadoc or usage whether they should do different things or this just happened because no one noticed we already had another method param ostate the composite state we are searching the states for  return collection the collection with found states
Arg,positive,add a path to the list of paths to be searched when looking for xmi files to resolve external references with the list is maintained in a static structure shared by all instances p todo it is desirable to have separate search paths for separate files  but more work is required in argouml so that it knows how to maintain separate contexts for the profiles and user models param path a directory path to add to the search path

Arg,positive,todo we do not want to do this once we have dropped uml  map uml names to uml equivalents
Arg,positive,todo comment by a rueckert i do not think it makes much sense to query interactions from a collaboration in uml  since this diagram does no longer exist and an interaction means something different in uml
Arg,positive,todo comment by a rueckert a rueckert gmx net i think  the handle holding the collaboration implementation  should rather be a collaborationuse in uml but as a workaround for now  i will try to get a collaboration representation  collaborationuse  and then try to get the owning classifier from there
Arg,positive,todo this probably ca not be implemented in a way that will make the uml ui happy needs to be generalized to uml  semantics

Arg,positive,todo moved this out of the implementation specific piece tfm everything is primary for now  ie not reverse engineered
Arg,positive,this keeps track of the editing domain that is used to track all changes to the model p todo this probably needs to be a set of editingdomain so that we can manage an editingdomain per project

Arg,positive,todo support more than one body language
Arg,positive,todo does corehelper getextendedclassifiers  object element  means all parents  direct and indirect  or only the direct parents ?
Arg,positive,todo what is the purpose of this ? why do we hide buttons here ? presumably if so we should not assume selectionclass
Arg,positive,todo we currently delete the old values before setting to something new this is a workaround to issue  we should consider giving an api to get the lower and upper values so that controls can listen directly to those rather than the element containing those values
Arg,positive,todo in uml x event has no parameters the event metaclass in uml x corresponds to the trigger metaclass in uml x  see uml superstructure page 
Arg,positive,todo this should be built by reflection from the metamodel tfm update for uml  x metamodel if not replaced by reflection

Arg,positive,todo use getmodelelementcontainer for transition
Arg,positive,todo we should not actually have to do all this work
Arg,positive,todo hook this creating of a new resource in to someplace more more appropriate  perhaps createmodel ?  better yet add a new method to model api to create a new top level project model xmi file so we do not depend on side effects
Arg,positive,todo check for resource to hold this and create if necessary ? this is a discrepancy between mdr which does it here and euml which does it as part of setrootmodel
Arg,positive,todo get setrootmodel are not specific to the model implementation they could probably be moved elsewhere tfm 
Arg,positive,i think that the synchronized access to idtoobjectmaps is required in order to respect the thread safe nature of the object fixme maybe this should be moved into xmireferenceresolverimpl  because it depends on internal implementation details of it
Arg,positive,todo we can choose between something which matches uml in name or something that matches in functionality we 've chosen functionality for now  but this will create a name conflict during the migration process tfm
Arg,positive,todo change to throw exception when uses are fixed throw new notimplementedexception non nls 
Arg,positive,a near clone of this code works fine outside of argouml  but throws a null pointer exception during the transform when run within argouml i think it is something to do with the class libraries being used  but i ca not figure out what  so i 've done a simpler  less efficient stepwise translation below in serialtransform
Arg,positive,todo bob says coding by use of side effect here maybe this should be done in a clearer way but it fixes http argouml tigris org issues show bug cgi ? id  it seems that when loading an xmi that is not contained in a zip file then the inputstream given as the argument to this method ca not be reused as it is at the end of the stream in that case systemid appears to be none null at this stage so if systemid is not null we recreate the inputsource
Arg,positive,create temporary file for output todo we should be able to chain this directly to xmi reader
Arg,positive,xmiwriter implementation for mdr this implementation is clumsy because the specified writer interface wants characters  while the xmiwriter wants an outputstream dealing in bytes we could easily create a writer from an outputstream  but the reverse is not true todo the old writer based interface can be removed when the deprecated modelimplementation getxmiwriter is removed author lmaitre
Arg,positive,todo return empty collection on null input or throw illegalargument ?
Arg,positive,todo an iterator filter would be nice here instead of the mucking around with the collection
Arg,positive,todo doing this violates the minimal cardinality of  if we allow it we at least need a critic to warn about it
Arg,positive,apply profile stereotype to make it a profile  our convention hack create that stereotype instead using the uml profile
Arg,positive,if systemid is a valid url  simply use it todo this causes a network connection attempt for profiles
Arg,positive,todo make this work when the given stereotype has more than one baseclass todo currently only works for stereotypes where the baseclass is equal to the given one inheritance does not work
Arg,positive,todo this should call the single namespace form getstereotype  it next stereo
Arg,positive,todo still not used  because in argouml string is hardwired
Arg,positive,todo mvw do we really look into super types of the stereotype  or should we be looking into super types of the baseclass ?
Arg,positive,todo using just the last piece of the id leaves the potential for name collisions if two linked files have the same name in different directories
Arg,positive,todo this should use a minimal update strategy instead of removing all and then adding all tfm 
Arg,positive,todo what type of validation can we do here on tagtype ?
Arg,positive,todo this can be simplified to just include  extend  setbase usecase  base
Arg,positive,anything not found is newly created  so return a null systemid indicating that it is in the parent document todo this assumption will be invalid if when we allow editing of linked sub models
Arg,positive,todo distinguish between deferred resolution and things which are unresolved at end of load and should be reported to user
Arg,positive,todo this assumes ranges are sorted is this true ? tfm
Arg,positive,todo is this adequate for finding profiles in java webstart jars ? tfm
Arg,positive,todo check whether this is really needed i think it is left over from an incomplete understanding of the magicdraw composition error problem tfm
Arg,positive,todo not sure whether the above is better in some cases  but the code below is better for both java web start and eclipse
Arg,positive,todo this returns a collection  not a single object is this what the callers expect ?
Arg,positive,todo this code manually processes the elementimports of a package  but we need to check whether mdr already does something similar automatically as part of its namespace processing tfm 
Arg,positive,todo this has different semantics than everything else

Arg,positive,this causes problems it can make multiple return messages refer to the same activator even if not returning to the same classifier role as the activator emenates from i'm not sure that changing the activator of one message should amend any other messages but this is certainly changing too many bob
Arg,positive,todo in this needs to be localized  but we do not have any localization capabilities in the model subsystem object args typename  elemname  alias misc name element import alias imported alias  return translator localize  misc name element import alias  args
Arg,positive,register a listener for metamodel class  and all its subclasses optionally qualified by a list of property names todo verify that property event names are legal for this class in the metamodel
Arg,positive,todo do we want to construct an artificial name here ?
Arg,positive,todo implement support for types other than string
Arg,positive,todo this should be done after all events are delivered  but leave it here for now to avoid last minute synchronization problems
Arg,positive,only do verification if debug level logging is on todo should we leave this on always ? tfm
Arg,positive,todo mvw this needs rethinking rework  i have the following questions why does it not search for a stereotype in the namespace using properties and only create a new stereotype if it will actually be used ? ie  why is there not a getstereotype  string name  string baseclass  ?  edited by dmst  these comments imported from nsuml implementation tfm see org argouml model extensionmechanismsfactory buildstereotype  java lang object  java lang object  java lang object
Arg,positive,todo the type of the model element used in a type parameter  ie the formal  needs to match the actual parameter that it gets replaced with later this code is going to restrict that to always being a parameter which does not seem right  but i do not have time to debug it right now tfm 
Arg,positive,todo this should be built by reflection from the metamodel tfm update for uml metamodel if not replaced by reflection
Arg,positive,todo a minimal update strategy would be better here to minimize work and events firing  but it may be better to deprecate the method and force calls to manage updates themselves  since they probably usually want to just add or remove a single element  tfm 
Arg,positive,todo this should use a minimal update strategy instead of removing everything and adding it again tfm
Arg,positive,todo this actually returns permissions with stereotypes of both access and import when the spec calls for only the former  but that seems to give different semantics to the way package imports work review to see which is wrong
Arg,positive,todo do we want to friend stereotypes too ? model getextensionmechanismshelper hasstereotype  permission  modelmanagementhelper friend stereotype
Arg,positive,todo we have multiple string representations for multiplicities these should be consolidated this form is used by org argouml uml reveng
Arg,positive,get elementresidences todo unused should be added to facade ? tfm param handle a modelelement return collection the elementresidence for this model element
Arg,positive,todo this is ambiguous as to whether it should be adding a container or resident
Arg,positive,todo this should either be extended to support all aggreationkinds or it should be simplified removed from the api tfm 
Arg,positive,todo it does not really make sense that a namespace would be returned as part of its own contents  but that is the historical behavior
Arg,positive,todo perhaps use a hashset or other collection with faster lookup performance in case our callers are doing naive contains lookups

Arg,positive,todo this should probably throw an exception if it gets invalid arguments rather than just returning null
Arg,positive,todo delete old multiplicity ? why is copy using hard coded value ? tfm
Arg,positive,todo as currently implemented  this expects a list of multiplicityranges is this an interface change from the nsuml implementation ? i suspect it used to accept a list of integers tfm see org argouml model datatypesfactory createmultiplicity  java util list

Arg,positive,the constructor param expressionmodel expression model  should be shared between language and body fields param notify set to true to forward events to model only one of language and body fields should have this set to true todo mvw i do not understand that
Arg,positive,to simplify implementation  we list all associations found with any of the classifiers represented by the linked instances p todo make a foolproof algorithm that only allows selecting associations that create a correct model also take into account n ary associations and associationclasses this algo best goes in the model subsystem  e g in a method getallpossibleassociationsforalink see org argouml uml ui umlcomboboxmodel buildmodellist

Arg,positive,todo we have some quirk that the a baseclass addition or removal from a steroetype comes back as an attributechangeevent rather than an associationchangeevent this needs further investigation to see if this can be made consistent
Arg,positive,todo rather than specifically ignore some item maybe it would be better to specifically state what items are of interest otherwise we may still be acting on other events we do not need
Arg,positive,todo this needs work we also need to listen to addition removal of states to from a classifierinstate
Arg,positive,todo we may want to restrict the list to parameters which conform to the following wfr parameter type ofstype or  parameter kind in and ofstype allsupertypes includes  type or parameter kind out or parameter kind return  and type allsupertypes includes  ofstype or  parameter kind inout and  ofstype allsupertypes includes  type  or type allsupertypes includes  ofstype
Arg,positive,todo getallmodelelementsofkind should probably do this processing of imported elements automatically
Arg,positive,todo part of this is copied from actiondeletemodelelement we maybe need some subclass for common code
Arg,positive,todo we should really test the model instead for this but we have no api yet can we just check if the collection to build the jlist control implements the list interface ?

Arg,positive,this interface contains methods to retrieve objects that represent the different uml types these objects are use as tokens used to create model elements in some methods todo there are parts of argouml which assume that the objects returned here are classes we should formalize that by changing the return types to match tfm  bob says there should be no such assumption in argouml can we document where these are ? see org argouml model umlfactory buildconnection  object  object  object  object  object  object  object  see org argouml model umlfactory buildnode  object
